<p class = "intro" > My name is Hunter Dale. I live in Beavercreek, Ohio with my parents. I work at an escape room. </p>
<p> I love movies, especially horror and action. Most of my free time is taken up by my best friend, Jennica, or video games. I also love music, especially Metal and Punk. </p>
<p> <span class = "sentence">I use the app Letterboxd a lot and want to create an app to do something similar. </span> I love fruit more than chocolate. I have a dog who is 14 years old and named Bella. </p>
<p> I own over 850 movies on Blu-Ray and DVD. I collect Anime figures and Manga. I think I am a pretty cool person? </p>
